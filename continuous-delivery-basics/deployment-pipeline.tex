How does ideal project look like?

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Ideal Project}
  As a \textbf{Business Owner} I'd like to have releases
  \begin{description}
   \item[often] so that I quickly understand whether market accepts my ideas 
   \item[low-risk] so that I don't loose money if something goes wrong
  \end{description}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Ideal Project}
  As a \textbf{Developer} I'd like to have releases
  \begin{description}
   \item[often] so that the risk of fail doesn't grow
   \item[often2] so that I get satisfaction from having results
   \item[low-risk] so that I don't overtime after failed release
   \item[quick] so that I don't do routine all the time
  \end{description}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Usual Project}
 \begin{itemize}
   \item Interval between releases is bigger than a month
   \item Release is manual and requires release instructions
   \item Release is stressful and risky
   \item Release procedure takes hours, they are routine
   \item Often there are failures that require manual steps to rollback
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  What does prevent us from building an Ideal Project?
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why do we fail?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Regression takes ages
    \item Doing big changes
    \item Manual Deployment, Rollback
    \item Some steps in the process take a lot of time (testing for instance)
    \item Complicated environment
    \item Previous failures, risks and stress that postope releases
    \item Corporate policies
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Continuous Delivery to rescue}
  CD touches a bunch of aspects related to the software process:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deployment Pipeline}
    \item Automated Deployment and Rollbacks
    \item Automated Functional Tests
    \item Configuration Management
    \item Continuous Integration
    \item Branching Strategies
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  Deployment Pipeline represents a pipe of CI steps we need to pass in order to achieve release.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Commit == binary}
  \textbf{Each} commit results in a binary file that is reused on all other steps.

  Possible obsticles:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Binary is configured on build phase
    \item Complexity of configuration
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What's cool about Deployment Pipelines}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Build cycle becomes faster
    \item You don't have deployment errors
    \item Deployment process is always documented and up-to-date
    \item If you have deployment errors, you can easily find them
    \item You're sure you didn't pass bugs because of automated functional tests
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
